# School Management System - Detailed Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive web-based School Management System built with Flask and SQLAlchemy that serves as a platform for schools to manage their administrative tasks, academic activities. The system supports multiple schools and implements a sophisticated role-based access control system with five distinct user roles: Super Admin, Admin, Teacher, Student, and Parent.

## Technical Stack
- **Backend Framework**: Flask (Python)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Template Engine**: Jinja2
- **Database**: SQLite (for development), can be configured for PostgreSQL or MySQL

## Database Relationships

1. **School-User Relationship**

   - Users are assigned to a specific school

2. **User Roles**
   - Many-to-many through UserRoles association table
   - Each user can have multiple roles (though typically one)

3. **Parent-Student Relationship**
   - Many-to-many through parent_student association table
   - Parents can have multiple children, students can have multiple parents/guardians

4. **Teacher-Subject Relationship**
   - Many-to-many through TeacherSubject association table
   - Teachers can teach multiple subjects, subjects can have multiple teachers

5. **Student-Subject Relationship**
   - Many-to-many through SubjectEnrollment association table
   - Students can enroll in multiple subjects, subjects can have multiple students

6. **Subject-Assignment/Test Relationship**
   - One-to-many (a subject has many assignments/tests)

7. **Student-Grade Relationship**
   - One-to-many (a student has many grades)
   - Grades are linked to specific assignments, tests, or subjects

8. **Student-Attendance Relationship**
   - One-to-many (a student has many attendance records)
   - Attendance records are subject-specific

## User Interface Design

   - Integration tests for workflows
   - User acceptance testing

Make the project correctly routed and seen the views. Make the good UI, as it was done by middle UI designer, don't use emojis, use only SVGs if needed. Make with green/blue/white color pallette, but if needed you can use another colors.
